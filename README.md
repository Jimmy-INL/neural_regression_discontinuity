# Neural Regression Discontinuity
In this repository, I show how the estimation of Regression Discontinuity Regression, a quasi-experimental method for causal inference in time-series, can be improved using Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks.

This work builds off "From Econometrics, With Love: Causes and Counterfactuals for Machine Learning", first presented at the SAP Conference for Machine Learning 2020, St. Leon Rot.
